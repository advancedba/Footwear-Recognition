# Footwear-Recognition
This is a footwear recogtion test based on simple shoes' images requested from 6pm.com.
We use Support Vector Machine and Classification Tree and finally get accuracy nearly to 99%.
In further implement, we will develop it into a recommendation system based on single image, and the output will be similar images of same label.
